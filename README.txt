This contains the Feature Article Validation Rule that we creted in our 'Rules Overview' session at Penn State Drupal Camp 2013.

This rule will check if an article has an image when a content contributor marks it as 'Featured'.  If it does not contain and image, the rule will un-check the feature option and display a message to the user.
